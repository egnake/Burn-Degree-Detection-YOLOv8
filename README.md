> **An advanced Computer Vision project designed to detect, classify, and analyze skin burn injuries in real-time using Deep Learning.**

## 📖 Overview

**BurnSentinel** is an AI-powered medical assistance tool that analyzes live video feeds or static images to identify skin burns. Leveraging the **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** architecture, it segments the injury area and classifies it into three medical severity levels: **1st Degree**, **2nd Degree**, and **3rd Degree**.

Beyond classification, the system acts as a "Smart First Aid Assistant," providing immediate, rule-based medical guidance specific to the detected burn type. This project explores the intersection of **Medical AI** and **Edge Computing**, optimized for high-performance inference on NVIDIA GPUs.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **⚡ Real-Time Inference:** Capable of processing high-FPS video feeds with low latency.
* **🧠 Multi-Class Detection:**
    * **1st Degree:** Superficial damage (Redness/Erythema).
    * **2nd Degree:** Partial thickness damage (Blistering/Bullae).
    * **3rd Degree:** Full thickness damage (Charring/Eschar).
* **🏥 Medical HUD:** Displays dynamic, color-coded bounding boxes and confidence scores.
* **❄️ Freeze & Analyze Mode:** Allows the user to pause the live feed (using `Spacebar`) to inspect the injury closely and read detailed treatment protocols.
* **🛡️ Robust AI Model:** Trained on a diverse dataset to distinguish burns from healthy skin.
